## Technical Details 

All approaches that take more than one byte are specified, alongside how many bytes they may take.

For strings and buffers, the data following the final length byte is equivalent to the data within the string/buffer.

For numbers, the data following the representation byte is equivalent to the little-endian representation of the number in bytes.

`table`  
Definition of array used: An array is a list of elements from index 1 to n where there exist no gaps between the integers 1 and n.  
The arraySize variable represents the amount of bytes used to store all of the values within the array part.  The minimum value for arraySize is arrayLen, but such an occurance is highly unlikely.  

The dictSize variable represents the amount of bytes used to store all of the keys and values within the dictionary part.  The minimum value for dictSize is dictLen * 2, but such an occurance is highly unlikely.

- [X] empty table [194]: The constant ```{}```
- [X] table [195]: A mixed table that contains both arrayend and tableend to terminate. (Takes 3 + arraySize + dictSize bytes)
- [X] equal_to_existing_value [196]: Two bytes of unique values, 61_440 are fixed and 4096 are cycled through (Takes 3 bytes)
- [X] array [197]: An array that uses tableend to terminate (Takes 2 + arraySize bytes)
- [X] dict [198]: A dictionary that uses tableend to terminate (Takes 2 + dictSize bytes) 
- [X] arrayend [199]: Used to terminate the array portion of a table
- [X] tableend [200]: Used to terminate a table
- [ ] UNKNOWN [201]: An approach that may be used in the future.

`userdata`
- [X] custom [202]: A user-defined function is used to read/write the information associated with the userdata (Takes 1+custom bytes)
- [X] nil [203]: Specifies that the userdata is not supported.
- [X] byte_constant [204-219]: This byte stores the id of a userdata constant (1-16)
- [X] char_constant_next [220-223]: The next byte stores the id of a userdata constant (Takes 2 bytes)

`future`
- [ ] future_approaches [224-239]: Approaches reserved for new types or expanding upon prior.

`extend`
- [ ] extend_approaches [240-255]: Approaches reserved for BufferSerializer extenders.
