# RISKS

This document outlines potential risks associated with the serialization and deserialization of data structures, particularly in the context of Luau tables and the BufferSerializer library. It is crucial to understand these risks to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in applications that utilize these techniques.

## General Risks
- Deeply nested or cyclic tables can lead to stack overflows or excessive memory consumption during deserialization.
- Most notably, if the `equal_to_existing_value` approach is used, an attacker may exploit this to cause data corruption or unexpected behavior by referencing existing values.

## Specific Risks
- **Userdata Custom Approach**  
  - Requires careful handling to ensure custom serialization and deserialization functions are compatible.

- **Constants Usage**  
  - Should be used sparingly and with caution. Conflicting or mismanaged constants can cause data corruption or unexpected behavior.
  - While constants can optimize size, over-reliance may lead to maintenance challenges.
